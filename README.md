# Predicting Car Damage Level for Insurance Claims Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Motivation

Between 2014 and 2023 there has been an increase of 63.8% in car insurance costs in the US, Florida being the most expensive state with an average yearly cost of $3,865 
for full coverage in 2024 [3]. Therefore, improving customer trust and reducing operational costs is paramount for companies to stay competitive. Evaluating the damage 
after a car accident occurs is one of the first critical steps in the insurance claim process. The current process involves an insurance adjuster evaluating vehicle damage, estimating repair costs, and processing claims, this can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, this process can lead to delays in claim settlements and customer dissatisfaction. The variability in assessments by different inspectors can lead to inconsistent estimates, complicating negotiations between insurers, repair shops, and customers. The motivation for this project is to address the need to streamline and improve the accuracy of the car accident damage assessment process.  
We believe a standardized, data driven solution will increase efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in claim processing.  

Our goal in this project is to learn more about computer vision algorithms and demonstrate how they can be applied to automate the damage assessment process for insurance 
claims. We aim to understand how to best devise a system capable of accurately identifying damage levels (minor, moderate, and severe) and producing consistent assessments 
from accident images. This will be accomplished by leveraging techniques such as image classification, image augmentation and deep learning.
